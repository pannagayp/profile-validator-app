    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage clients, emails, and attachments in a secure and scalable manner, ensuring authorization independence. The core concept is to enable processing incoming emails, extract data from attachments, and manage client profiles. The structure promotes clear security rules and facilitates efficient queries. Authorization Independence is achieved through the design of the `emails` collection which holds a nullable reference to `clientId`. \n\nThe data model assumes an automated system triggered by new email arrivals. If the email sender is a known `Client`, associated attachment content is extracted. If the sender is unknown, an auto-reply is triggered. The system's primary data flow involves ingesting new emails and processing file attachments.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The `client` collection stores the profiles while the `emails` collection manages emails with links to attachments. This segregation allows listing emails securely, as validation status and other profile data are stored separately in the client profile.\n"
